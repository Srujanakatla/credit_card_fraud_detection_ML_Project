THe DATASET:
The data was taken from kaggle site:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

the columns do not have physical significance directly visible since as per the source(Kaggle), the data was compressed using principle component Analysis(PCA) in order to protect the privacy of the individuals while making a realistic secnario dataset available to public.
